## Add the demo video
 - I've add the video which is indicating a demo version for the each project

## Fix the key features
 - When admin or user enter this pop-up, they can see the lists of the features and there would be the 'edit' button for editting.
 - Instead of using a strikethrough, change the text color of completed items. This keeps the text readable while still signaling completion.
    Best color choices:
    Gray (#888888 or #A0A0A0): Subtle and widely used for de-emphasizing.
    Green (#4CAF50 or #2ECC71): Universally associated with success/completion.
    Blue (#2196F3 or #3498DB): Calming and professional, good for corporate settings.
    Tip: Avoid red or yellow-they can imply warnings or errors.
- The check box should have a space betwen the words.
